This will be done on movie reviews, using the [IMDb dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).\n","\n","In this first notebook, we'll start very simple to understand the general concepts whilst not really caring about good results. Further notebooks will build on this knowledge and we'll actually get good results.\n","\n","### Introduction\n","\n","We'll be using a **recurrent neural network** (RNN) as they are commonly used in analysing sequences. An RNN takes in sequence of words, $X=\\{x_1, ..., x_T\\}$, one at a time, and produces a _hidden state_, $h$, for each word. We use the RNN _recurrently_ by feeding in the current word $x_t$ as well as the hidden state from the previous word, $h_{t-1}$, to produce the next hidden state, $h_t$. \n","\n","$$h_t = \\text{RNN}(x_t, h_{t-1})$$\n","\n","Once we have our final hidden state, $h_T$, (from feeding in the last word in the sequence, $x_T$) we feed it through a linear layer, $f$, (also known as a fully connected layer), to receive our predicted sentiment, $\\hat{y} = f(h_T)$.\n","\n","Below shows an example sentence, with the RNN predicting zero, which indicates a negative sentiment. The RNN is shown in orange and the linear layer shown in silver. Note that we use the same RNN for every word, i.e. it has the same parameters. The initial hidden state, $h_0$, is a tensor initialized to all zeros. \n","\n","![](assets/sentiment1.png)\n","\n","**Note:** some layers and steps have been omitted from the diagram, but these will be explained later."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PDSgYJua7SWa","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Preparing Data\n","\n","One of the main concepts of TorchText is the `Field`.
