    "# Problem 1: Stochastic TX-TL\n",
    "(BFS Problem 4.1) Consider a standard model of transcription and translation with probabilistic creation and degradation of discrete mRNA and protein molecules. The propensity functions for each reaction are as follows:\n",
    " * Probability of transcribing 1 mRNA molecule: 0.2dt\n",
    " * Probability of degrading 1 mRNA molecule: 0.5dt and is proportional to the number of mRNA molecules.\n",
    " * Probability of translating 1 protein: 5dt and is proportional to the number of mRNA molecules.\n",
    " * Probability of degrading 1 protein molecule: 0.5dt and is proportional to the number of protein molecules.\n",

    "It has been shown that negative autoregulation reduces stochastic cell-cell variability (\"noise\") in gene expression. Read [the paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/35014651) published by Becskei and Serrano in Nature, 2000. In this problem, we use the concepts from that paper and our stochastic simulation tools to demonstrate this using simple models.\n",

Simulate time courses of both models for 100 different “cells” using the following parameters: $k = 2$, $k_0 = 1$, $d = 1$, $K = 1$. Plot the nonregulated and autoregulated systems in two separate plots. Comment on the variation you see in the time courses.\n",
