    "We will be running the matrix multiplication on Mare Nostrum. Feel free to look at `matmul_main.py` (the main application) and the `run_pycompss.sh` (the helper script that realizes the Mare Nostrum reservation and starts the application).\n",

    "To run the application just connect to Mare Nostrum and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd dataclay-patc21/matrices\n",

    "You can check your queued jobs with the `squeue` command and cancel them if you have messed up with `scancel <jobid>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution logs can be seen in the file `compss-<jobid>.{out,err}`. You can look at them postmortem or tail them by doing `tail -F compss-<jobid>.{out,err}`. Be patient! You may have to wait a couple of minutes for the job to be accepted. And then it will be a couple more minutes for dataClay to be initialized and COMPSs to launch.\n",
